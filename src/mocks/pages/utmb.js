    brief: "<strong>UTMB®</strong> - the world's biggest trail-running organization, has tasked our agency with creation of two interconnected online platforms, firstly <strong>UTMB World Series</strong>, a portal for the organization and its global series of races organized around the world, all leading up to the ultimate final race of the series - the famous ultramarathon <strong>UTMB® Ultra Trail de Mont Blanc</strong>. <br/><br/> Secondly, the <strong>design and development of a site factory</strong> based on <strong>React.js</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>, capable of dynamically generating a unique website for each separate race of the UTMB® World Series. <br/><br/>This site factory would be utilizing the same component library to generate the main site and all race sites, while using a single instance of <strong>headless content-management system</strong>, using <strong>Strapi</strong> to build a fast and self-hosted API.",

    role: 'My main role in the team was the <strong>integration of react-based reusable UI components</strong> for the site factory and main site, making sure they represent the <strong>best practices and highest standards</strong> in terms of <strong>usability, accessibility and performance.</strong> <br/><br/> This process included regular <strong>UI/UX consultation</strong> and <strong>review meetings with the client</strong> and project manager to discuss various usability issues and <strong>UX improvement proposals</strong>, as well as to demonstrate various benefits that the implementation of proposed enhancements brought into production.',
    achievement:
        'During this project, our team has used a <strong>scrum framework</strong>, following the principles of <strong>agile software development</strong>, which has allowed us to <strong>continuously deliver and present meaningful pieces of work</strong> to our client on weekly basis, <strong>effectively respond to change in client requirements</strong> at any stage of project, and most importantly <strong>demonstrate an increase in team productivity on almost weekly basis</strong>. <br/><br/> This was achieved thanks to efficient workload estiimation, short but intensive sprints, as well as regular <strong>sprint retrospectives</strong> and <strong>code reviews</strong>. <br/><br/> My personal contribution in this area, was the creation of <strong>team-specific workflow</strong> to be applied on every individual task, establishing <strong>crucial points</strong> and <strong>requirements</strong> that needed to be fulfilled in order to move task from one stage of development to another (on a Kanban board)',
